## design patterns used : 

* dependecy injection, a lot of time to inject services, components in our controllers or repositories in services ... 
* we implemented services in way to ensure scalibility of our code, like sending notif, via email , we can after decide to implement anothet type of senders so we used adapter pattern
* we alwayes opted for composition more than inheritance
